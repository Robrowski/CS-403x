# How to Discover Snaps
Turn on your mobile data and location services AND GO FOR A WALK!!! In order to optimize power efficiency, we actually stop polling your GPS when you aren't moving! If you are having a hard time discovering snaps, open up the settings and either turn off activity recognition (and melt your battery) or change the GPS mode to HIGH_POWER (and melt your battery).

The whole point of this app is snap DISCOVERY!!! 


# Taking Pictures
The button on the bottom takes the picture, make sure you hold still! The button in the top left switches between selfie-mode and back-facing mode.

# Planting Photos
Planting a photo uploads your picture anonymously and publicly to Imgur (where it is basically hidden in the obscurity of the internet). Others using this app can now discover your snap!

Pressing the back arrow will trash the picture.

Those yellow buttons in the bottom left set the "discoverability". Basically, big circle means easy to find, small circle means secret. How many secret snaps can you find?

# Discovered Snaps
These are the snaps you discovered. Make sure you check them out soon, because they will disappear after a day!

# Viewing Snaps

This is where the snap was planted and later discovered. The circle is how big an area the snap could be discovered in. The blue marker is your location, if you are still in the area.
